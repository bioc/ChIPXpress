Title: ChIPXpress: enhanced transcription factor target gene
        identification from ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data using publicly
        available gene expression profiles

Description: ChIPXpress takes as input predicted TF bound genes from
        ChIPx data and uses a corresponding database of gene expression
        profiles downloaded from NCBI GEO to rank the TF bound targets
        in order of which gene is most likely to be functional TF
        target.
